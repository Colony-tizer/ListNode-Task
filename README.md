# ListNode. Task
Implement ListNode serialization and deserialization algorithm based on the following ListNode object structure

# The requirements

ListNode must have only four members: 
- ListNode prev
- ListNode next
- ListNode rand -- pointer to the random element in the list
- string data

ListRand (list of ListNode s) must have only three embers:
- ListNode head
- ListNode tail
- int count

(De)Serialization should have time complexity less than quadratic.
